## Overview

This was my first practice with HTML and CSS. First i tried to use BootStrap to help me but without the complete understandig of the tool i wasn't able to made a good replica with it. So I decided to recreate with pure CSS to create a better understanding of CSS and to practice what i've learned. 

### The challenge

- View the optimal layout depending on their device's screen size(Desktop:1440px; Mobile:375px)
- See hover and focus states for interactive elements
